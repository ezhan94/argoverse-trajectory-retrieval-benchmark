# Argoverse Trajectory Retrieval Benchmark dataset

## Data

Trajectory data comes from the [Argoverse Motion Forecasting dataset](https://www.argoverse.org/data.html#forecasting-link), which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.argoverse.org/data.html#download-link). [Tutorials](https://github.com/argoai/argoverse-api) are available for working with maps and visualizing trajectories.

`train_queries.py`, `test_queries.py`, `train_retrievals.py`, `test retrievals.py` contain the trajectory IDs that belong to each set.

`labels.py` contains the 8 training intents and the intent labels for the training query and retrieval sets.
